# Daily-expense-table

This table was created using **Microsoft Excel** to help users track their spending easily and efficiently.

S/N: Serial number for each entry

Date: The date the expense occurred

Amount: The amount spent

Category: A dropdown menu with predefined options **(using data validation)** to ensure consistent input

Notes: Optional details or description of the expense

On the side, a fixed Balance field represents the user's starting funds. Below it, a calculated Total (Subtracted from Balance) shows the total amount spent based on the entries in the table, helping users see how much of their balance has been used.

This setup makes expense tracking straightforward while offering a quick reference to remaining funds.
